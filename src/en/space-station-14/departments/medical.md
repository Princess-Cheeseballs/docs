# Medical


## Concept
Medical as a department is primarily tasked with keeping the crew alive and healthy. 
The challenge of that very simple task is that the crew lives in a tin can that is prone to very bloody and violent accidents and disasters.
It's medicals job to be able to respond to a variety of different injuries and deaths, from a variety of different sources and to diagnose and cure so that the crew can get back to work or at least limp their way to the evacuation shuttle.
The tools medical uses should be scarce, but never scarce enough to halt the department, should be time consuming such that death is dangerous, but never time consuming enough that there's a lot of waiting involved in healing, and should keep medical constantly moving, but not so constant that it becomes overwhelming or unreasonably swamped. 
Given the right tools medical should be able to deal with most bodies coming in, but there should always be a clear line of when a body is unrecoverable. Some wounds are too grievous, too rotten, too deliberate to recover from. That's what the morgue is for.

## Design Pillars
Medical as a department needs to have consistency to work. But things should never be so consistent that they become mundane.
In order to maintain this balance, there are a number of design pillars that must be upheld. 

### Pillar 1: Injuries should match the danger of the source.
 The difference between a common workplace accident and getting shot to pieces shouldn't be one number being higher.

  > Common injuries should be easier to treat, almost trivially so. Something you come into medical for, get a band aid and a pill and then be on your way as to not slow down the department.

  > Rarer job hazards should require some care and maybe more intensive treatments depending on the degree of the mistake. Got bitten a few times by a carp and lost your hand? A prosthetic limb can fix that. Decided to hang around the singularity for a bit too long? You'll probably need a coupe new organs alongside those radiation burns. 

 > And most important, if someone really wants you dead then medical shouldn't be able to reverse that easily. 

 ### Pillar 2: Treatment should be reactive.
 Nobody likes doing the same thing over and over again. That's boring! As much as possible injuries should be dynamic and interesting. 
 
 > There should be no cure all medicine that is always the correct option to use. Any that could exist should be limited by drawbacks of side effects, scarcity or exclusiveness.
 
 > Real injuries shouldn't be static, gunshot wounds should worsen over time if left untreated, a patient in crit should get worse and become harder to heal, a dead body should rot and that rot should make getting them back up harder and harder the more time passes. A dying crewmember should need to be monitored because no medicine should be a cure all. You should have to put effort into treating bad injuries, it shouldn't just be about waiting for a number to go up after clicking 1-3 times with the correct healing item. 

### Pillar 3: Medicine should be interesting
Players should want to know how to be a doctor, not only for the purpose it serves but for the depth and complexity involved.

> Everything from treatment, to chemistry, to surgery should have mechanical depth where knowledge and creativity is rewarded and experimentation is encouraged. 

> Getting the best numbers should be mechanically discouraged by having a wide variety of options available. The same injury might call for different treatments depending on context, some poisons might suit some situations better than others. Any "best of their class" meta items or tactics should be discouraged through complexity and should never so heavily outweigh the simpler options that it becomes a burden to not understand them. Not knowing the meta shouldn't put you at a major disadvantage. 

### Pillar 4: Information is a resource
The information that is communicated to a doctor should be something doctors have to actively try and get. Medical scanners shouldn't be an end all be all. As with Pillar 2, no treatment should be a cure all, and therefore no source of information should trumph another. 

> Getting information from a patient should be the fastest and easiest way to diagnose, but not the only option for obvious reasons.

> Handheld items should only give some of the story, with the rest having to be intuited through knowledge or context.

> No information should be completely obscured. There should be fallbacks in case other methods of information gathering fail so that a medical player never feels stuck. These fallback methods should be always available but should be inconvenient so players don't rely on them and instead learn to master their medical skills.

## Objectives
Medical is arguably the most important department for the crew round flow wise. If a player can trust that the medical department will be there to catch them when they fall, they're more likely to go out and make mistakes, and mistakes are fun. A traitor trying to assassinate their target should be having to make sure that medical wont be able to save them in addition to security not being able to catch them. A nuclear operative should be thinking about and accounting for the fact that medical is going to be turning dead bodies into walking obstacles. 

From a doctor's perspective, they should be a neutral but station leaning party. It's their job to keep these crewmembers alive in spite of everything and they should at least have a vague idea of how to handle that.

An experienced doctor should never feel overwhelmed but their work also shouldn't feel mundane. Each injury should be a puzzle to solve, some more simple than others but none feeling impossible or discouraging to solve. Intuiting and gathering information should be their most important skill, such that they always have to put some effort in to do their job well. 

At the same time, medical shouldn't have such a high learning curve or barrier to entry that it becomes obtuse. Tools should be intuitive, information should be immediately understood upon being recieved and the potential solutions obvious. While problems may worsen over time, the stress shouldn't be about "I have no clue what to do" but instead "I'm not sure which option is the best one right now". 

Medical should try to stay within the medical department. Their best tools should be static such that a traitor can't run around with better healing than what the security officer they just shot is going to be getting on their medical bed that they're strapped to. Nobody should be able to become a perfect one crewmember walking medical department. At the same time, a doctor should be able to reasonably handle treating a single patient or a group of patients on their own. Given the nature of the game, there's a very high chance their will be more bodies in the department than there are doctors.
